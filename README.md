Company Fun Day

1. To run database, you'll need to have Docker Desktop setup.  Run docker `docker-compose up` in the main directory.
That will spin up the instance of the MongoDB container.

2. To run the Frontend React App, `cd app/http/web/app` and run `npm start` (you may need to run npm install first).

On localhost 8080 the app will spin up. Right now it's setup to have you login to an Okta free account to authenticate.
